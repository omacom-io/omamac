# Omamac

Omamac is a keyboard-centric setup for macOS that takes inspiration from [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/). It's built on Rectangle Pro for layouts, Hammerspoon for navigation between windows, Raycast for app launching, and keybindings for moving between workspaces. It also sets up all the basic developer tooling needed for a Terminal-driven workflow.
